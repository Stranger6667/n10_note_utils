# Psychology and Life, 20th, 12 Emotion, Stress, and Health

Q: **emotion** is a complex reaction pattern, by which an individual attempts to deal with a {{**personally significant**}} matter or event.

q: what's the difference between emotion and mood? (hint: contingency between responses and events, duration, intensity) {#q1234}

a: the differences are:

* emotions are **specific** responses to **specific** events——in that sense, emotions are typically relatively **short** lived and relatively **intense**.
* By contrast, moods are often **less intense** and may **last several days**. There's often a **weaker** connection between moods and triggering events. You might be in a good or bad mood **without** knowing exactly why.

Q: duration of emotion is relatively {{**short**}}

Q: intensity of emotion is relatively {{**intense**}}

Q: duration of mood may {{last several days}}

Q: intensity of mood is {{less intense}}

Q: connection between moods and triggering events is {{weak}}, You might be in a good or bad mood **without** knowing exactly why.

Q: There are **seven** expressions are **recognized and produced** **worldwide** in response to the emotions:

* {{**happiness(快乐)**}}
* {{**surprise(惊讶)**}}
* {{**anger(愤怒)**}}
* {{**disgust(厌恶、反感)**}}
* {{**fear(恐惧)**}}
* {{**sadness(悲伤)**}}
* {{**contempt(轻蔑)**}}

Q: 特定的情绪体验引发不同模式的自主神经系统活动，尽管不同的文化对情绪有不同的限制，但ANS的表现在不同文化之间有高度的{{相似性}}

Q: the **autonomic nervous system (ANS)** prepares the body for emotional responses through the action of both its {{**sympathetic(交感神经的)**}} and {{**parasympathetic(副交感神经的)**}} divisions

Q: With **mild(轻微的), unpleasant** stimulation, the {{**sympathetic**}} division of **autonomic nervous system (ANS)** is more active

Q: With **more intense** stimulation of either unpleasant or pleasant, {{**both**}} divisions are increasingly involved.

Q: Physiologically, strong emotions such as **fear or anger** activate the body's {{**emergency reaction system/fight-or-flight response**}}, which swiftly and silently prepares the body for potential danger

Q: Integration of both the **hormonal** and the **neural** aspects of **arousal** is controlled by the {{**hypothalamus(下丘脑)**}} and {{**the limbic system**}}, control systems for emotions and for patterns of attack, defense, and flight

Q: the {{**amygdala(杏仁核)**}} of the limbic system that acts as a {{gateway}} for emotion and as a {{filter}} for memory. The amygdala does this by attaching {{meaning}} to the information it receives from the senses.

Q: fMRI scans showed greater activity in the brain's {{left}} hemisphere for {{positive}} pictures

Q: fMRI scans showed greater activity in the brain's {{right}} hemisphere for {{negative}} pictures

Q: 左右半球的分工

* {{positive}} -> {{左半球}}
* {{negative}} -> {{右半球}}

Q: the view that emotion stems from {{bodily feedback}} became known as the {{James–Lange}} theory of emotion

Q: **Cannon–Bard theory of emotion** is a theory stating that an emotional stimulus produces two {{**co-occurring**}} reactions——arousal and experience of emotion——that {{independent}} between each other

q: which theory of emotion stating that an emotional stimulus produces two **co-occurring** reactions——arousal and experience of emotion——that independent between each other?

a: Cannon–Bard theory of emotion

Q: According to Cannon, emotion requires that the {{brain}} intercede(调解) between the input stimulation and the output response.

Q: **cognitive appraisal theory of emotion** is a theory stating that the experience of emotion is the {{**joint effect**}} of {{physiological arousal}} and {{cognitive appraisal}}, which serves to determine how an ambiguous inner state of arousal will be labeled.

q: which theory of emotion stating that the experience of emotion is the joint effect of physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal, which serves to determine how an ambiguous inner state of arousal will be labeled?

a: cognitive appraisal theory of emotion

Q: According to Richard Lazarus' cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, emotional experience **cannot** be understood **solely** in terms of what happens in the person or in the brain, but grows out of ongoing transactions with the {{environment}} that are evaluated

Q: Richard Lazarus also emphasized that cognitive appraisal often occurs {{**without**}}(with or without?) conscious thought. When you have {{past experiences}} that link emotions to situations, you need **not** explicitly search the environment for an interpretation of your arousal.

Q: people generally interpret **unexplained** physical arousal as {{**negative**}}

q: interpretations of all emotional experiences require appraisal, is this statement true?

a: not true

* interpretations of at least some emotional experiences may not require appraisal
* people have preferences——emotional responses to stimuli——without knowing why

Q: people in negative moods tend to process information in a more {{detailed and effortful}} fashion than their peers in positive moods

Q: Your mood will also have an impact on the way in which information gets committed to memory, Negative moods tends to {{sharpen}} the focus of attention

Q: Your mood will also have an impact on the way in which information gets committed to memory, positive moods tend to {{broaden}} that focus

Q: people who are in **positive** moods may find it {{harder}}(easier or harder?) to ignore {{irrelevant}} information

Q: people in positive moods produce {{more}}(more or less?) creative thinking and problem solving than people in neutral moods

q: do people have control over the impact their emotions will have on themself and on others?

a: yes, people have the capacity for emotion regulation

q: What might be the single most important source of happiness?

a: Research suggests that **good social relationships** are the single most important source of happiness.

q: What is the general impact of mood on information processing?

a: People in negative moods tend to process information in a more detailed and effortful fashion than people in positive moods.

Q:  **acute stress** is a transient(短暂的) state of arousal with typically {{**sudden onset**}}, {{**short duration**}}, and often {{**great intensity**}}

Q: **chronic stress** is the physiological or psychological response to a {{**prolonged(持久的，长期的)**}}(duration) internal or external stressful event

q: Does the stressor need remain physically present to have its effects on chronic stress?

a: no, recollections of it can substitute for its presence and sustain chronic stress

Q: recent evidence suggests that the fight-or-flight response is characteristic only of {{males}}(male or female?)

Q: Taylor and her colleagues suggest that females do not experience fight-or-flight. Rather, these researchers argue that stressors lead females to experience a {{**tend-and-befriend response**}}

Q: general adaptation syndrome (GAS) is the {{physiological}} consequences of {{severe}} stress.

Q: general adaptation syndrome (GAS) has three stages:

* Stage I: {{**Alarm reactions**}} are brief periods of bodily arousal that prepare the body for vigorous(充满活力的) activity
  * If a stressor is {{prolonged}}, the body enters stage II
* Stage II: **resistance**——a state of{{ moderate(变和缓; 减轻, 减弱)}} arousal. During the stage of resistance, the organism can {{endure and resist}} further debilitating(使身心衰弱) effects of prolonged stressors.
  * if the stressor is sufficiently {{long lasting or intense}}, the body's {{**resources become depleted**}} and the organism enters the stage III
* Stage III: {{exhaustion}}: may cause {{illnesses}} that could not be wholly explained by physical causes

Q: many psychological reactions are {{learned}}, They depend on {{perceptions}} and {{interpretations}} of the {{world}}

Q: The influence of life events on subsequent mental and physical health has been a target of considerable research. It started in the 1960s with the development of the {{Social Readjustment Rating Scale (社会再适应量表 SRRS)}}

Q: 参与者在90年代体验到的压力水平总体上{{高}}于60年代的同辈人

q: what type of event is particularly stressfull?

a: An event that is **negative** but also **uncontrollable**, **unpredictable**, or **ambiguous** is particularly stressful

Q: Types of Coping Responses

* {{**anticipatory coping**}}: Efforts made in advance of a potentially stressful event
* {{**problem-directed coping**}}: Change stressor or one's relationship to it through direct actions and/or problem-solving strategies
* {{**emotion-focused coping**}}: Change self through activities that make one feel better but do not chnage the stressor

q: what is problem-directed coping?

a: Change stressor or one's relationship to it through direct actions and/or problem-solving strategies

q: what is emotion-focused coping?

a: Change self through activities that make one feel better but do not chnage the stressor

Q: only {{**women**}}(men or women?) were much affected by the level of emotional support

Q: 什么因素会影响病人对医嘱的遵守？

* {{病人对疾病严重性的感知}}：严重时会遵医嘱，但如果觉得没得救了，往往会不遵医嘱
* {{社会支持}}
* {{患者对医生的信任程度}}：患者与医生态度的匹配非常重要

q: What conditions are necessary to produce the relaxation response?

a: To produce the relaxation response, people must find a quiet environment in which they can rest in a comfortable position with their eyes closed and use a repetitive mental device.

q: What is the central goal for researchers who study psychoneuroimmunology?

a: Researchers who study psychoneuroimmunology seek to understand how **psychological states** have an impact on the **immune system**.

q: What is the "toxic" aspect of Type A personalities?

a: The aspect of Type A personality that puts people at risk for illness is **hostility**.

q: what is Type A behavior pattern?

a: A complex pattern of behaviors and emotions that includes **excessive emphasis** on **competition**, **aggression**, **impatience**, and **hostility**

q: what is biofeedback(生物反馈) treatment?

a: 可视化身体内在的反应(血压、肌肉紧张度等)，从而辅助病人来控制这些内在的反应

q: what is biopsychosocial model?

a: A model of health and illness that suggests links among the nervous system, the immune system, behavioral styles, cognitive processing, and environmental domains of health.
