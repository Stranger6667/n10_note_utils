Often, 
however, your performance doesn’t show everything that you 
have learned. Sometimes, too, you have acquired general atti-
tudes, such as an appreciation of modern art or an understand-
ing of Eastern philosophy, that may not be apparent in your 
measurable actions. 

In such instances, you have achieved a po-
tential for behavior change because you have learned attitudes 
and values that can influence the kinds of books you read or 
the way you spend your leisure time. 

This is an example of the 
learning-performance distinction—the difference between 
what has been learned and what is expressed, or performed, in 
overt behavior.
